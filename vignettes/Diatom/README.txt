Diatoms_workshops  (old name: Workshop-diatoms.Rmd)

For use in diatom workshops to introduce use of neotoma2.  First used for the Joint Aquatic Sciences Meeting (JASM) in Grand Rapids, MI in May 2022.  Future uses include possible virtual workshops and the IAL / IPA meeting in Argentina in November 2022.

 

Diatoms_neo2.Rmd  (old names: diatoms.Rmd, NEW_diatoms.Rmd)

Basic code for using neotoma2 to retrieve data from the Neotoma database.  Created using a copy of the new Diatoms_workshops.Rmd and then added additional code from the old diatoms.Rmd.

 

Diatoms_analysis  (old name: NEstatesData2021.Rmd)

Basic code for analyzing and presenting data that has been retrieved using neotoma2 code that is included in Diatoms_neo2.Rmd.  Document started with several sections from NEstatesData2021.Rmd, which was created to make a presentation for the May 2022 JASM meeting in Grand Rapids MI.  Analysis for the presentation was based on data from the northeast US, as part of work for the Northeast Lake Sediment Diatom Collaborative.  NEstatesData2021.Rmd will be maintained as a separate document, but not as a vignette.

 

Diatoms_taxa

Includes code for working with diatom taxonomy.  Some code moved from diatoms.rmd.
