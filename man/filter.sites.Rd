\title{Apply a filter for Neotoma sites objects.}
\usage{
\method{filter}{sites}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A sites object.}

\item{...}{arguments to filter by.}
}
\description{
The \code{filter} function takes a \code{sites} object
and allows a user to filter on a number of properties. Since a sites obhect
is a nested object (it contains collection units, datasets, samples, etc.)
the degree to which filtering occurs depends on the amount of data contained
within the sites object. Filtering parameters include:
\itemize{
\item{"siteid"}{A numeric site identifer from the Neotoma Database}
\item{"sitename"}{The character string sitename.}
\item{"lat"}{A numeric latitude value.}
\item{"long"}{A numeric longitude value.}
\item{"altitude"}{The elevation of the site. Note that some sites do not
include elevation information. For these an NA value appears, and they
would be removed when using an elevation filter.}
\item{"datasetid"}{A numeric datasetid from Neotoma.}
\item{"database"}{A character string naming the constituent database
from which the dataset is drawn.}
\item{"datasettype"}{A character string representing one of the many
daataset types within Neotoma.}
\item{"age_range_old"}{A dataset-level parameter indicating the oldest
date covered by the dataset chronology.}
\item{"age_range_young"}{A dataset-level parameter indicating the youngest
date covered by the dataset chronology.}
\item{"notes"}{Free-form dataset notes provided by the dataset PI(s),
analysts or data stewards.}
\item{"collectionunitid"}{A numeric collection unit identifier from
Neotoma.}
\item{"handle"}{A character string identifying the collection unit. These
are often shorter form names (originally a default 8 character length).}
\item{"collectionunitname"}{A character string identifying the collection
unit name.}
\item{"colldate"}{The date on which the collection unit was sampled. Many
of these are empty.}
\item{"location"}{A free-form character string indicating the location of
the collection unit within the site.}
\item{"waterdepth"}{A numeric depth at which the core was obtained.}
\item{"collunittype"}{A character string for the collection unit type.}
\item{"collectiondevice"}{A fixed vocabulary term for the collection
device.}
\item{"depositionalenvironment"}{A fixed vocaublary name for the
depositional environment.}
