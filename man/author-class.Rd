\title{An S4 class for the authors of a Neotoma publication.}
\description{
This class combines the S4 class \code{contact} with a numeric
author order. This allows us to reuse \code{contact} objects, and to assign
the authorship order within a publication. The full set of authors for
a publication are represented by the \code{authors} object.
}
\examples{
simon <- new("contact", familyname = "Goring", givennames = "Simon J.")
firstauthor <- new("author", author = simon, order = 1)
